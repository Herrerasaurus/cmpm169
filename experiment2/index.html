				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to recreate the Victorian-era piece, "Gallop in Time", with image movement mimicing the affect of real life chronophotography.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Images are placed in horizontal grids, with the frame being dependant on the distance between the image and mouse. Image positioning is also dependent on the mouse distance, and an offset is used to position the image closer or further from the mouse.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked by myself on this project, and overall I’m proud of what I came up with. I had a bit of a difficult time in the beginning decided what to do for this project, but when I came across the “Gallop in Time” during my search I thought it would be fun to try and recreate for this project. In general I find Victorian Era animation to be pretty interesting, and I had considered choosing other versions of this type of animation, however I think the galloping horse was the most fun to work with. 
					The early part of the assignment of getting the image into a grid and getting it to animate was overall pretty easy to figure out and I was able to get that aspect to work pretty quickly. The more difficult part of this assignment came in figuring out how I wanted to innovate. It was a lot of trial and error in figuring out what I thought would look cool and what I was actually able to accomplish. When I finally decided on trying to make the frames move like in real life versions of this animation, it was particularly difficult to try and make the movements look fluid. A good chunk of my innovation stage of the project had choppy looking movement. Although when I finally figured it out it, the solution seemed so obvious.
					Overally I had a good time with this project and am happy how it turned out.
