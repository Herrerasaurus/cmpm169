				<p>
					A container which holds spheres that are representative of your mood based on what color is selected on the sidebar.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					The project uses WEBGL to create a 3D environment where the user can track their mood with colored spheres. The spheres are created when the user clicks on the canvas and are dropped at the location of the mouse. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>	
					I worked on this project individually. Overall I like the outcome of this project, I think its a fun way to collect data and the type of thing I would personally use to track my mood if I were to do so. It was a bit difficult figuring out collisions, and that took up most of my time, but it was worth it once it started to work properly. If I had more time I think it would be fun to use other shapes rather than spheres, but I think thats something I would come back to implement in the future when I had time to figure that out.
