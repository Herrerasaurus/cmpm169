				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiement, we are trying to recreate the hurricane swirl visual that is typically displayed on weather channels.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>We first created a moving spiral, then based on a noise map we colored in the lines of the spiral to mimic a weather pattern.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Hasina’s Reflection:
					The process involved experimenting with p5.js to create animated shapes. However, I faced many difficulties with getting the growth and shrinkage of the rectangles to work smoothly.
					
					Initially, I think I accidentally updating the rectangle's size too quickly, but after adjusting the update logic, the oscillating behavior was fixed.
					
					Another challenge was managing the color changes and ensuring they were applied correctly across the shapes.
					
					The success was that I was able to integrate transformations, animations, and interactivity to achieve a vibrant, animated spiral effect with a rectangle.
					
					Celeste’s Reflection:
					I worked on implementing the heat map coloring to the spiral. Overall I think we did a good job with the project, and the result is similar to what I had in mind for this project when we started. There was a lot of trial and error in getting the colors to work in a way that felt natural, so the main low was just finding a method that worked best. It would have been easier to choose from a gradient of multiple colors, but I unfortunately could only work with two at a time which became a challenge, but I think the solution I came up with worked well. I think the main highlight of the project was adding the finishing touches with the cloud effect, I feel like it pulled together the whole project.
