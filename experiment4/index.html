				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>	I worked on this project by myself, and did the work alone. I had a bit more trouble with this experiment in comparison to previous ones because I had a hard time figuring out what kind of project I wanted to do. I started working on different ideas before this, but I couldn’t come up with something I thought was fun, so it took me a while to properly get started. After coming up with an idea that I was able to properly execute, I think that this project went well overall. The only real issue I had come across was the picture frame covering the photos, which I was unable to fix, however, the solution I came up with for this problem was easy to implement. Overall I think I’m happy with what I came up with, but if I had more time I would try and implement more sticker options to customize the photos.
