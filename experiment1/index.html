				<h2>⋆. 𐙚 ̊Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was an individual assignment so I was the sole contributor. It was a fairly easy experiment as it was only working getting myself familiar with the class. I didn’t really run into any problems setting up the webpage and overall this assignment went smoothly for me. The only real low of the assignment would be figuring out how the submission requirements apply to this experiment specifically.
